# InnovaSys — Secure Cloud Architecture Website

InnovaSys is a responsive three-page marketing site for a fictional cloud
architecture consultancy specialising in SOC 2 and HIPAA-aware solutions for
FinTech, HealthTech and GovTech teams.

## What’s inside

- Pages: `index.html` (home), `solutions.html` (service pillars, accelerators),
  `methodology.html` (engagement approach, contact form).
- Frontend: HTML5, custom CSS with variables (`assets/css/styles.css`), and
  Bootstrap 5.3.3 via CDN.
- UX: Accessible navigation with skip links, responsive cards and sections,
  example YAML snippet, and a mailto-driven contact form.

## Run locally

- Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve the folder (e.g.
  `python -m http.server 8000`) and browse to `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Deploy

- Static-site ready: upload the repository contents to any static host (e.g.
  GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) with no build step required.
